# zenplots 1.0.5

* zenplot now (invisibly) returns a list with two extra classes
  
  - `zenplot` to identify that the structure is a zenplot
  - one of `zengraphics`, `zenGrid`, or `zenLoon` to indicate which graphics
    package was used.

  documentation updated accordingly.

* updated documentation on `zenpath` to mention that `pairs` must describe
  a connected graph.
