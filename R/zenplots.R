#' zenplots: Zigzag Expanded Navigation Plots
#'
#' Zenplots, like pairs plots (scatterplot matrices), lay out a large
#' number of one- and two-dimensional plots in an organized way.
#' 
#' Unlike pairs plots, zenplots can lay out a much larger number of
#' plots by pursuing a zigzagging layout (following a zenpath) of 
#' alternating one- and two-dimensional plots. 
#' 
#' The plots can be created by R's base graphics package, by the grid
#' graphics package, or even made interactive (brushing, etc.) by using
#' using the loon package.
