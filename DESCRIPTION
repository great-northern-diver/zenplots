Title: Zigzag Expanded Navigation Plots
Description: Graphical tools for visualizing high-dimensional data along a path
 of alternating one- and two-dimensional plots. Note that this
 includes interactive graphics plots based on 'loon' in turn based on tcltk 
 (included as part of the standard R distribution).  It also requires 'graph' from Bioconductor.
