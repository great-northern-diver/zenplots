Description: Graphical tools for visualizing high-dimensional data along a
    path of alternating one- and two-dimensional plots. Includes optional
    interactive graphics via 'loon' (which uses 'tcltk' from base R).
    Support is provided for constructing graph structures and, when
    available, plotting them with Bioconductor packages (e.g., 'graph',
    'Rgraphviz'); these are optional and examples/vignettes are skipped if
    they are not installed. For algorithms and further details, see
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v095.i04>.
