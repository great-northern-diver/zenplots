### TODO #######################################################################

- Bug under macOS (gdb fails; works fine under Linux):
  source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
  biocLite("graph") # correctly installs in version independent library
  biocLite("Rgraphviz")
  install.packages(c("TSP", "gtools", "PairViz", "zenplots"))
  zenplots::zenplot(matrix(rnorm(100), ncol = 5))
  # => after the plot window is opened and the plot finished, close the
  plot window. Check the R process. Under Mac, I see:

   *** caught segfault ***
  address 0x18, cause 'memory not mapped'

  Possible actions:
  1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
  2: normal R exit
  3: exit R without saving workspace
  4: exit R saving workspace

- rownames of 'x' are lost after burst (maybe force it on every column?)
  *might* be a problem for time series
- Maybe we can speed-up the computation of a full Eulerian and (thus?) avoid the
  dependence on 'graph' and 'PairViz'?
- Fix all *_*_loon functions (see grid/graphics) for the use of 'loc' etc.
- Fix/adapt intro.Rmd + write paper (use cross2d() for showing ACFs and CCFs)


### New ideas/features #########################################################

- layout() (base graphics) has a limit of 10007 plots, see ?layout.
  pairs() doesn't have this limit, it uses par(mfrow =
  c(length(horInd), length(verInd))) instead. But we can't do that
  because width1d and width2d would not be respected then.
  (Even if so, we would loop over all rows and columns and figure out
  which plots contain which variables or work with par(mfg = ...) to
  plot in the right plot -- but that only works if all plots have the
  same scales ("global"))
- write gridMerge which essentially builds gTree(children = gList(plot1call, plot2call))
- be able to write plot1d = list(fun = c("hist", "density", "label"),
                                 args = list(fun1 = , fun2 = , fun3 = ))
  and get overlaid 1d plots (same for 2d)
